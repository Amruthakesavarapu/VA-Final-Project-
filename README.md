## Introduction
The IMDB Movie Ratings dataset provides an interactive exploration of the top 1,000 movies, focusing on their ratings, genres, directors, and release years. This project aims to uncover patterns in movie ratings and highlight the elements contributing to the success of highly rated films. Through dynamic visualizations, users can better understand evolving cinematic trends and gain insights into audience preferences.

## Data Operation/Abstraction Design

I got my data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows). The dataset underwent cleaning to handle missing values, standardize genres, and create useful aggregations for deeper insights. Features multiple interactive visualizations like bar charts for popular genres, line charts for rating trends over time, scatter plots for gross earnings vs ratings, and charts showcasing top directors. Users can interactively filter by genres and release years for a personalized exploration. The intuitive design ensures accessibility for users of all experience levels, making it easy to navigate and analyze.

## Future work:
Future enhancements could include expanding the dataset to cover newer movies, linking user reviews to ratings for sentiment analysis, and using machine learning to predict trends in ratings and genres. These additions would provide deeper insights and a broader perspective on cinematic trends.
